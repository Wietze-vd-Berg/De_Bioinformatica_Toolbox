## Description
This web-based tool allows users to analyze gene expression differences in RNA samples using Salmon, a wicked-fast and accurate RNA-seq
quantification tool. The program is designed to help the user compare gene expression levels between two RNA samples.

## Requirements
Machine with python 2.7 or higher. <br>
This guide is for Linux operating systems.

## Installation
### Part 1: Miniconda
This step can be skipped if you've already installed mini/ana-conda
```
First, Miniconda needs to be installed.
You can also install the full Conda, but since we only need Bioconda, it’s unnecessary because the full Conda is quite large.
Everything in parentheses is an explanation and should not be executed!
Everything between <> is a physical button you need to press!
 
1. Go to www.anaconda.com/download
 
2. Install the Linux version for Python 3.12 64-Bit (x86) Installer.
 
3. Once installed, open the terminal.
 
4. cd Downloads (or the other folder where Miniconda was installed)
 
5. ls -l (check if the file is executable, if it doesn’t show -rwxr, it is not executable, follow steps 3 and 4 if needed)
 
6. chmod u+x <tab> (u = user, x adds the execute permission, tab for auto-complete, if tab doesn’t work, type the full name, mind the spelling!)
 
7. ls -l (check if -rwxr is correctly set)
 
Now Miniconda can be executed.
 
1. ./<tab> (miniconda)
 
2. Press <enter> (multiple times to go through all the documentation).
 
3. Press Q.
 
4. Yes.
 
5. Press <enter>.
 
The download of Miniconda will now begin.
yes (this will automatically start Conda when you open the terminal)
```
### Part 2: Bioconda
This step can be skipped if anaconda is already installed
 
```
Fortunately, we’ve now gotten through the most annoying part.
 
1. conda config --add channels bioconda
 
2. conda config --set channel_priority strict
 
This will install Bioconda.
```
### Part 3: Salmon
 
```
Now, you can finally install Salmon!
 
1. conda create -n salmon salmon
 
This installs Salmon and creates a custom environment called salmon.
To activate and deactivate this environment, use the following commands:
 
1. conda activate salmon
 
2. conda deactivate
```
